# Kanban Board UWP

This Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application uses a Kanban Board to create a workflow for a specific task or multiple tasks. Still a work in progress, more features coming!

My initial purpose of this application was to track a single programming progject and keep track of where I'm at on certain tasks 
for that project.  

Implemented with a Sqlite database to store the tasks and uses CRUD operations against the data. You can view the .db file generated by the project with https://sqlitebrowser.org/

##### Basic design with tasks spread across the board:

##### Allows multiple sections in a column and drag and drop between columns seamlessly:

##### New Task Dialog:

You can type in tags into the textbox and it will add them into a listview

##### Edit Task Dialog, each task is assigned a unqiue id:

Tags in the list view are shown

## Getting Started

The program requires a license from Syncfusion since the Kanban Control is a control used by them, but they provide a free community license here: https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense

Essentially, generate a key for the UWP controls and head to App.xaml.cs and add your key into the string "YOUR_API_KEY". 

### Prerequisites

Minimum version: Windows 10, Version 1809

Target Version: Windows 10, Version 1903

#### Nuget Packages Required:

Microsoft Sqlite should be installed on your system by default. So, the nuget package "Microsoft.Data.Sqlite" or "Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core" will
work. SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_winsqlite3. (Tutorial on these installations can be found on microsoft docs here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases)

Syncfusion.SfKanban.UWP Nuget Package should be installed.
