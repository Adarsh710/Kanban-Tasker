# Kanban Tasker

This Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application uses a Kanban Board to create a workflow for multiple projects, tasks, etc.

Initial purpose of this application was to track progress on multiple projects and homework for college, but have made it into more of a *general* Kanban Board so that others are able to use it!

## Update 7/30/2019:
Work on this project will be coming to a pause. I've discovered two major bugs within Syncfusions SfKanban control which prevents some essential functionality that is essential to a kanban board and I'm unable to work around it due to their control not being open sourced
  * The bugs are reported and being looked into by Syncfusion, but no further update on when/if it will be patched
  * Currently looking into the possibility of creating a custom control to essentially "mock" theirs so that the project is able to be   finished
  
## Kanban Tasker Details

Old designs from the start of the app can be found in: **KanbanTasker/Images/OLD_....**

Uses a kanban UI control created by [Syncfusion](https://www.syncfusion.com). Also implemented with a Sqlite database to store the tasks and uses Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations against the data (For information on viewing the database created by sqlite, look at [Getting Started](#getting-started))

##### Simple design with a popout pane to edit and create your tasks
 * Quick access to pane comes from hovering over the task and selecting the edit icon
   * **Note:** Tablet users need to touch and hold the task for a context menu to show (Right-click is enabled for desktop/laptop users too)
 * Tags in the pane can range in width and height. If the tag is longer than the width of the pane, it will wrap to a new row and  increase the height

##### Card design for tasks
  * Hover over a task to view the edit and delete buttons
  * Priority indicator has three options as of now: Low (Green), Medium (Yellow), High (Red)
  * Mouse reveal effect added to the bottom priority indicator border
  * Cards can vary in width and height. Wrapping added to card tags as well

##### Ability to collapse columns
  * Support to collapse columns added so you're able to focus on the important tasks at hand
  * Includes in app notifications to indicate whether your insertion, deletion, or update was successfull or not

##### Ability to drag cards across columns for easy workflow structure
  * **Note:** Both major bugs reported to Syncfusion resides in the events in their source code for dragging to columns (Read below for more details)
  * Columns support multiple categories per column. For instance, the 'Done' column has categories *Review* and *Done*, which you will see when dragging to a column that has multiple categories 
    * Able to see the categories for the current column in the pane too

## Getting Started

### Debugging

The program requires a license from Syncfusion since the Kanban Control is a control used by them, but they provide a free community license here: https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense

Essentially, generate a key for the UWP controls and head to App.xaml.cs and add your key into the string "YOUR_API_KEY". 

### Database generated by sqlite

You can view the .db file generated by sqlite with https://sqlitebrowser.org/

* The database file, .db, will be located in your ***Users->AppData (Make sure hidden items is on)->Local->Packages->(Search for db name)***
  * The database name is **kanbantaskerdb.db**
  * All database work is handled and located located in *DataProvider.cs*
* Sqlite Browser should open automatically to your user profile. Navigate to View and select the checkbox to view ***Hidden Items*** so that App Data will show (if not showing already)

### Prerequisites

Minimum version: Windows 10, Version 1809

Target Version: Windows 10, Version 1903

#### Nuget Packages Required:

* Microsoft Sqlite should be installed on your system by default. So, the nuget package *"Microsoft.Data.Sqlite"* or *"Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core"* will work 

* *SQLitePCLRaw.bundle_winsqlite3* 

* *Syncfusion.SfKanban.UWP* package should be installed

* Tutorial on these installations can be found on microsoft docs here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/data-access/sqlite-databases
